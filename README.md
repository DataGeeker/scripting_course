## Try Linux on a VM

* [Simple guide to install Linux as Virtual Machine](http://www.storagecraft.com/blog/the-dead-simple-guide-to-installing-a-linux-virtual-machine-on-windows/)
* For Linux distro, you can check out a custom [Porteus](http://build.porteus.org/) build I made with addition of gvim, Perl, Python 2 and Python 3. It is a light weight distro, < 200MB ISO file (so, selecting RAM size of 512MB is enough for most purposes) and boots usually within 5 seconds
  * [Porteus_32bit.iso](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7SzVctdXWlUYy1QZG1NX2xyYVk)
  * [Porteus_64bit.iso](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7SzVctdXWlUV3kyNlhMU29PMUk)
  * Both the builds have a folder at `/tmp/useful_files/` which contains dot files (to be copied to home directory) and handful of Perl and Python 3 programs for learning purposes
  * The default passwords are `toor` for root and `guest` for guest - [Porteus FAQ](http://www.porteus.org/faq.html)
* If you get errors like **kernel panic**, you might have to [Enable Intel VT-x in Your Computer’s BIOS or UEFI Firmware](http://www.howtogeek.com/213795/how-to-enable-intel-vt-x-in-your-computers-bios-or-uefi-firmware/)

## dot files
Do NOT copy bash and vim customization files (files starting with .) directly to your home directory. You might overwrite useful settings already present. Understand them and add as necessary
